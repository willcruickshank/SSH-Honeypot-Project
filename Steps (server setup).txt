1. I used Google Cloud as my server that contained my honeypot.

2. Once signed up and into google cloud, I created a VM that ran Ubuntu and configured it with basic settings.

3. I then went into my VPC network, IP Addresses, External IP Addresses. Inside here I changed my IP address type from Ephemeral to Static.

4. I then went back to my VM where I could now SSH into the server right from the Google Cloud webbpage.

5. From that SSH session I ran "sudo apt-get update". I then configured /etc/ssh/sshd_config to open port 22. I also changed the "PasswordAuthentication" from "no" to "yes" allowing password authentication to be used when using SSH to connect to the server.

6. Used useradd to create user "John".

7. Once inside user "John" I created fake directories that the hacker would assume are real.

8. Added user "Bob, Terry, Amy, Sam"

9. Created group "finance"

10. Added "Bob, Terry, Amy, Sam" to group "finance"

11. Changed directory "finance" group permissions to only allow group members of "finance" to read write and execute.

12. Added "Liam, Emma, Noah, Olivia" to group "hr"

13. Added "Ava, Ethan, Sophia, Isabella" to group "sales"

14. Added "Jackson, Mia, Aiden, Joe" to group "shared"

15. Changed directory "hr, sales, shared and engineering" group permissions to only allow group members to read write and execute.

16. Created a script that made fake .txt files containing fake user transactions in the finances directory.

17. Installed python onto the server.

18. Installed SSHPry2.0 from a git lab respitory onto the server using "git clone https://github.com/nopernik/SSHPry2.0.git". (this will be used to track the hackers SSH session movements)

19. Installed MSMTP and Heirloom-mailx onto our server and configured cronjob settings to send a alert email every minute to "socanalystproject4@gmail.com" when a SSH session has been opened.
